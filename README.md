# Battleship
## How it's played?
Battleship (also known as Battleships or Sea Battle) is a strategy type guessing game for two players. It is played on ruled grids (paper or board) on which each player's fleet of warships are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.
This app lets you play battleship against the computer. At first you have to place your 5 ships by hovering and clickin on your board, while the computer places its ships randomly. You make the first move, by attacking enemy's board. If you hit a ship, an 'x' will appear, otherwise, a dot will appear. If you sunk a whole ship, the borders of that ship will appear. After you make your move, the computer will make its move and you will contonue like this until somebody wins and you can then choose to play again.

## What I learned
This was quite a challenge because I had to implement all the logic behind the game, the hovering and placing the ships on the board and also it was done using Test Driven Development and had to create tests for functions before actually implementing it, which was unusual for me. I learned the benefits and importance of TDD.
